Code for the Junkyard Temples, Set II, Solanum project

This is code for my installation "Junkyard Temples, Set II:
Solanum." It is based on a poem by Rebecca Morgan Frank.

This isn't all the code (much less files!) you'll need to
make this work. There are a number of sound files, as well
as .pde (Processing) files that you'd need too. This code
won't even work without RTcmix (www.rtcmix.org). It's 
mostly for my sanity of this having a place to live. I
may add the .pde files later.

If you really, really, really are interested in seeing 
this mess work, send me a message, and I'll get you
what you need.
