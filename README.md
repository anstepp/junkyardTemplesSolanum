Code for the Junkyard Temples, Set II, Solanum project

This is code for my installation "Junkyard Temples, Set II:
Solanum." It is based on a poem by Rebecca Morgan Frank.

This isn't all the code (much less files!) you'll need to
make this work. There are a number of sound files, as well
as .pde (Processing) files that you'd need too. This code
won't even work without RTcmix (www.rtcmix.org).

A sample of what the result sounds and looks like is here:
